This is the one and only Wat Mod with Cats, Blocks, Items, Ores, Tools, Plants, Food, Biomes. For cats there's Luna, Stormy, White Kitty, Sir Meows (that's not all of them there is about 74 cats). Blocks are Cat Face, Reck Ore That Explodes (I know there is no W at the start it's meant to be like that) but i don't want to spoil everything about it so not everything will be said.
Then biomes there is Cat Biome, Reck Biome, Calico Biome (some still need to be fixed to spawn in the world).
