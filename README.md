# Wat Mod Generations

## Made for use with MCreator 2025.1.13416

### Version 1.1.2b test1

Let's start off with the cats, the most important part of the mod. So there are all kinds of cats you got Luna, Sir Meows, red, Stormy, the cat god, wuneya meows, and much more (you can also tame some of these cats) but this world can't be always safe with cats running around, when night comes around you have the same cats but with holes and weird colors on them roaming around instead, these are called corruptions, some are strong others not so much (also when a normal cat dies it becomes a corruption). Finally for cats we have the flying variant these cats are the same as the normal ones but they well, can fly. Next we have tools, so you can make tools but first you need to find some ore (hopefully not white kitty ore) then if you have the right tool level you can mine it but if not you get nothing, but anyways after you get the cat you can make some weapons for fighting with a stick or 2 and the cats that you found and done. Finally the extra stuff, so first if you still have a cat from the ore and you find a blank cat you can kill the blank cat and it will drop cat essence, then you can merge the two to make a cat spawn egg (the the spawn egg is of whatever cat ore you mined).
